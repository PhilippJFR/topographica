<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The cerebral cortex of mammals primarily consists of a set of brain
areas organized as topographic maps (<a class="reference external" href="#references">Kaas et al. 1997</a>, <a class="reference external" href="#references">Vanessen
et al. 2001</a>). These maps contain systematic two-dimensional
representations of features relevant to sensory, motor, and/or
associative processing, such as retinal position, sound frequency,
line orientation, or sensory or motor motion direction (<a class="reference external" href="#references">Blasdel
1992</a>, <a class="reference external" href="#references">Merzenich et al. 1975</a>, <a class="reference external" href="#references">Weliky et al. 1996</a>).
Understanding the development and function of topographic maps is
crucial for understanding brain function, and will require
integrating large-scale experimental imaging results with
single-unit studies of individual neurons and their connections.</p>
<p>Computational simulations have proven to be a powerful tool in this
endeavor. In a simulation, it is possible to explore how topographic
maps can emerge from the behavior of single neurons, both during
development and during perceptual and motor processing in the adult.
(For a review of this class of models, see <a class="reference external" href="#references">Swindale et al. 1996</a>.)
However, the models to date have been limited in size and scope
because existing simulation tools do not provide specific support
for biologically realistic, densely interconnected topographic maps.
Existing biological neural simulators, such as <a class="reference external" href="http://kacy.neuro.duke.edu/">Neuron</a> (<a class="reference external" href="#references">Hines et
al. 1997</a>) and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/">GENESIS</a> (<a class="reference external" href="#references">Bower et al. 1998</a>), primarily focus
on detailed studies of individual neurons or very small networks of
them. Tools for simulating large populations of abstract units, such
as PDP++ (<a class="reference external" href="#references">O&#8217;Reilly et al, 2000</a>) and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mathworks.com/">Matlab</a> focus primarily on
engineering or cognitive science rather than neurobiological
applications. Other simulators also lack specific support for
measuring topographic map structure or generating input patterns at
the topographic map level.</p>
<p>The Topographica map-level simulator is designed to make it
practical to simulate large-scale, detailed models of topographic
maps. Topographica complements the existing low-level and abstract
simulators, focusing on biologically realistic networks of tens or
hundreds of thousands of neurons, forming topographic maps
containing tens or hundreds of millions of connections. The goals of
models at this level include understanding how topographic maps
develop, how much of this development is driven by the environment,
what computations the adult maps perform, how high-level
capabilities are implemented by these maps, and how to relate
large-scale phenomena to the activity of single units in maps. The
overall goal is generally to understand the brain at a scale that is
directly relevant to behavior.</p>
<p>Topographica was developed through a collaboration between the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a>,
funded by the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/neuroinformatics/">Human Brain Project</a> of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov">National Institutes of
Mental Health</a>. Now that the simulator has been released, it is a
fully open source project managed by <a class="reference external" href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jbednar/">James A. Bednar</a>, who
coordinates contributions from all users. Binaries and source code
are all freely available through the internet at
<a class="reference external" href="http://topographica.org">topographica.org</a>, and volunteers are encouraged to join as
Topographica users and developers.</p>
<p>In the sections below, we describe the models and modeling
approaches supported by Topographica, how the simulator is designed,
and how it can be used to advance the field of computational
neuroscience.</p>
<div class="section" id="scope-and-modeling-approach">
<h2>Scope and modeling approach<a class="headerlink" href="#scope-and-modeling-approach" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Topographica is designed to simulate topographic maps in any
two-dimensional cortical or subcortical region, such as visual,
auditory, somatosensory, proprioceptive, and motor maps, plus the
relevant parts of the external environment. Typically, models will
include multiple brain regions, such as a part of an auditory or
visual processing pathway, and simulate a large enough area to allow
the organization and function of each map to be studied.</p>
<p>To make it practical to model topographic maps at this large scale,
the fundamental neural unit in the simulator is a two-dimensional
<em>sheet</em> of neurons, rather than a neuron or a part of a neuron.
Conceptually, a sheet is a continuous, two-dimensional area (as in
<a class="reference external" href="#references">Amari</a>, <a class="reference external" href="#references">Roque da Silva Filho et al. 1992</a>), which is typically
approximated by a finite array of individual neurons. Topographica
models consist of an interconnected set of such sheets, where each
brain region is represented by one or more sheets.</p>
<div class="figure align-right" id="generic-model">
<img alt="Topographica model of the visual system" src="../_images/generic-cortical-hierarchy-model.png" />
<p class="caption">Sample Topographica model of the visual system</p>
</div>
<p>The figure at right shows a sample Topographica model of the early
visual system (<a class="reference external" href="#references">Bednar et al. 2003</a>, <a class="reference external" href="#references">Bednar et al. 2004</a>). In
this model, the eye is represented by three sheets: a sheet
representing an array of photoreceptors, plus two sheets
representing different types of retinal ganglion cells. The lateral
geniculate nucleus of the thalamus is represented by two sheets, and
three cortical areas are represented by one sheet each. Each of
these sheets can be coarse or detailed, plastic or fixed, and simple
or complex, as needed for a particular study.</p>
<p>Sheets can be connected to other sheets in any combination,
including lateral connections from the same sheet to itself, and
recurrent feedback between sheets. Sheet-to-sheet connections are
called <em>projections</em>; these typically consist of a large set of
individual connections between units in each sheet. For one unit in
each sheet in the figure, example connections are shown for each
projection, including lateral projections in V1 and higher areas.
Each circular patch of connections is called a <em>connection field</em>,
consisting of input connections from a spatially restricted region
of a sheet.</p>
<p>Similar models can be used for topographic maps in somatosensory,
auditory, and motor cortex. Current biologically realistic models
include only a small number of sheets starting with a sensory area,
but Topographica is designed to make larger, more complex models
possible to simulate and to understand. Explicitly formulating
models at the sheet level is crucial to the simulator design,
because it allows user parameters, model specifications, and
interfaces to be independent of the details of how each sheet is
implemented.</p>
<p>As a result, the user can easily trade off between simulation detail
and computational requirements, depending on the specific phenomena
under study in a given simulator run. (See <a class="reference external" href="#references">Bednar et al. 2004</a> for
more details on model scaling.) If enough computational power and
experimental measurements are available, models can be simulated at
full scale, with as many neurons and connections as in the animal
system being studied. More typically, a less-dense approximation
will be used, requiring only ordinary PC workstations. Because the
same model specifications and parameters can be used in each case,
switching between levels of analysis does not require extensive
parameter tuning or debugging, as would be required in neuron-level
or engineering-oriented simulators.</p>
<p>For most simulations, the individual neuron models within sheets can
be implemented at a high level, consisting of single-compartment
firing-rate or integrate-and-fire units. More detailed neuron models
can also be used, when required for experimental validation or to
simulate specific phenomena. We plan for these models to be
implemented using interfaces to existing low-level simulators such
as NEURON and GENESIS, and have implemented preliminary versions
using NEST.</p>

<div class="section" id="software-architecture-and-implementation">
<h2>Software architecture and implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#software-architecture-and-implementation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Topographica is implemented as a set of <a class="reference external" href="../Reference_Manual/index.html#core">packages providing the core
functionality</a>, including the graphical user interface (GUI), plus
an <a class="reference external" href="../Reference_Manual/index.html#library">extensible library of models, analysis routines, and
visualizations</a>. The model primitives library consists of objects
useful in constructing a model, such as sheets, projections, neural
response functions, and learning rules. Many predefined objects are
included, and adding new object types is designed to be
straightforward. These building blocks are combined into a model
using either the GUI or the Python scripting language.</p>
<p>The analysis and visualization libraries include measurement and
plotting capabilities geared towards large, two-dimensional areas.
They also focus on data displays that can be compared with
experimental results, such as optical imaging recordings, for
validating models and for generating predictions.</p>
<div class="figure align-right">
<img alt="Screenshot of Topographica visualisations" src="../_images/060220_topographica_screen_shot_small.png" />
<p class="caption">Screenshot of Topographica visualisations</p>
</div>
<p>The figure at right shows a Topographica 0.9.1 screenshot with
examples of the visualization types supported in that version; the
exact contents of each window will vary in other Topographica
versions. Here the user is studying the behavior of an orientation
map in the primary visual cortex (V1), using a model similar to the
one depicted <a class="reference internal" href="#generic-model"><em>above</em></a>. The window at the bottom labeled
``Orientation Preference&#8217;&#8217; shows the self-organized orientation
map in V1; each pixel represents the preferred orientation of cells
at that location in the V1 sheet, color-coded using the key at the
left. The window labeled ``Activity&#8217;&#8217; shows a sample visual image
on the left, along with the responses of the OFF-center and
ON-center retinal ganglia and LGN (labeled ``LGNOff&#8217;&#8217; and
``LGNOn&#8217;&#8216;, and V1 (labeled ``Primary&#8217;&#8216;). The input pattern was
generated using the ``Preview&#8217;&#8217; dialog in the center, currently
displaying a Gabor-shaped pattern yet to be presented. The window
labeled ``Connection Fields&#8217;&#8217; shows the strengths of the LGN
connections to one neuron in V1. The color-coded lateral inhibitory
weights for a regular sampling of the V1 neurons are shown in the
``Projection&#8217;&#8217; window at the top; neurons tend to connect to their
immediate neighbors and to distant neurons of the same orientation.
Distortions in the mapping from retina to V1 are shown in the
``Topographic mapping&#8217;&#8217; window, which visualizes the preferred
location in retinal space of each V1 neuron. This type of
large-scale analysis is difficult with existing simulators, but
Topographica is well suited for it.</p>
<p>To allow large models to be executed quickly, the numerically
intensive portions of the simulator are implemented in C++. Equally
important, however, is that prototyping be fast and flexible, and
that new architectures and other extensions be easy to explore and
test. Although C++ allows the fine control over machine resources
that is necessary for peak performance, it is difficult to write,
debug and maintain complex systems in C++ or other similarly high
performance languages.</p>
<p>To provide flexibility, the bulk of the simulator is implemented in
the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org">Python scripting language</a>. Python is an interactive
high-level language that allows rapid software development and
interactive debugging, and includes a wide variety of widely
supported software libraries for tasks such as data analysis,
statistical measurements, and visualization. Unlike the script
languages typically included in simulators, Python is a complete,
well-defined, mature language with a strong user base. As a result,
it enjoys strong support outside of the field of computational
neuroscience, which provides much greater flexibility for users, and
also makes the task of future maintenance easier.</p>
<p>The following sections will introduce specific features of
Topographica, focusing on how they can be used to construct
large-scale models of topographic areas. A good way to make this
material more concrete is to work through one or more of the
<a class="reference external" href="../Tutorials/">Topographica tutorials</a>, to gain experience using Topographica for
a particular task. More details about the specific objects discussed
can be found in the <a class="reference external" href="../Reference_Manual/">reference manual</a>.</p>
