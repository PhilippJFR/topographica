<h1>Topographica Model Editor<a class="headerlink" href="#topographica-model-editor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Model Editor allows you to view, manipulate or create a
Topographica model. By combining pre-defined components and changing
each component&#8217;s parameters, you can produce useful models without
any programming. The result can then be saved to a .ty script, which
you can edit to add any features not yet supported by the Model
Editor.</p>
<div class="section" id="opening-the-model-editor">
<h2>Opening the Model Editor<a class="headerlink" href="#opening-the-model-editor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The model editor can be accessed through the Topographica console.
Select the Simulation menu in the console&#8217;s top menu bar, and choose
the model editor. A new window will appear with a toolbar on the
left, a view bar at the top and a work area in the middle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="viewing-a-model">
<h2>Viewing a Model<a class="headerlink" href="#viewing-a-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For an existing model, the model editor allows you to see how the
components of the model are connected, as well as allowing you to
change the properties of any component.</p>
<p>First load the model you wish to visualise and then open a model
editor window (as described above). The model editor will
automatically display the existing model. The location of each Sheet
will typically be random initially, but the Sheets can be rearranged
using the Move tool.</p>
<div class="section" id="representations">
<h3>Representations<a class="headerlink" href="#representations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are two main classes of component used to define a model:
Sheets and Projections.</p>
<p>Sheets are the main computational unit in Topographica and are
represented by a parallelogram. The default view indicates the size
and shape of the sheet. The editor also allows you to plot a density
grid over the sheet. This grid indicates how closely packed the
neurons are on a sheet. This can be achieved by right clicking in
the main window and selecting Toggle Density Grid from the Sheet
options menu. The other option, Toggle Activity, allows you to
display the actual activity of the sheets. If you only want to view
the activity of one sheet then right click on the particular sheet
and select Activity from the Change View menu. The activity of each
neuron of the sheet is plotted onto the parallelogram, so the
density of the sheet will determine how detailed the image appears.</p>
<p>Although the sheets are the main units, they are each independent of
one another, and thus they need some form of connection to be a
functioning network. Projections form a uni-directional connection
between sheets, allowing activity to propagate through a model. The
projections allow each neuron on one sheet to be connected to a
certain area on the other sheet; this area is called the neuron&#8217;s
ConnectionField. The default view plots a ConnectionField to scale.
Other views can be selected by right clicking on the desired
projection, and selecting Fixed Size (to turn off the size scaling)
or Line (to connect Sheets using a plain line rather than a
rendition of a ConnectionField).</p>
<p>The editor represents connections that join a sheet to itself as a
dotted ellipse around the centre of the sheet. These projections
allow each neuron on a sheet to be stimulated by the previous
activity within a localized area. A looped line is used as the line
representation of the projection.</p>
<p>The name of each sheet and projection is displayed beside its
representation in the canvas. To find out the name of a projection
that links a sheet to itself, hover the mouse over the
representation. If it is not obvious which name is linked with an
item, right click on the representation and select Properties. The
name is displayed at the top of the window. To view other properties
of a component refer to section <a class="reference external" href="#the-parameters">The Parameters</a>, which describes
the properties window.</p>
<p>In this image you can see the representations used in the model
editor for sheets and connections. a) marks a connection that joins
from sheet b) to sheet c). The representation for connections to and
from the same sheet is marked d) and a density grid and activity
plot can be viewed on e) and f) respectively:</p>

<div class="section" id="creating-a-model">
<h2>Creating a Model<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Creating a new model for Topographica can be achieved in two ways.
If you have programming experience, the most flexible option is to
define a model directly using Python script, usually starting with
one of the scripts that are distributed with Topographica in the
examples directory. A much simpler, though more limited, approach is
to use the model editor to either create a brand new model, or
manipulate an existing model.</p>
<p>To create a new model, you need to specify the computational
elements required and how they should be connected. First, open a
new model editor window as described in Opening the Model Editor. If
a model is loaded, the editor work area will display the model as
described in Viewing a Model. Now you are ready to specify your
model.</p>
<div class="section" id="toolbar">
<h3>Toolbar<a class="headerlink" href="#toolbar" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>On the left hand side of the editor is a toolbar that sets the mode
of the editor&#8217;s work area. There are three items; the arrow, for
selecting and moving items in the window; an object pull down,
allowing you to enter a new sheet into the window; a connection pull
down, allowing you to make connections between sheets in the window:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="" src="../_images/editortoolbaritems.png" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-work-area">
<h3>The Work Area<a class="headerlink" href="#the-work-area" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The main part of the editor is the work area (canvas), this displays
a representation of the model that Topographica is currently using.
If you haven&#8217;t opened a model, this area will be empty. The first
thing you may want to do is add a sheet to the model. Click on the
sheet pull down menu and a list of all the types of sheet available
to you will appear. This list is formed from the pre-defined library
of Topographica, covered later. Select the type of sheet that you
want to be part of your model. For example, you may wish to provide
some stimulus to the model by using a GeneratorSheet, in this case
you would select GeneratorSheet from the menu. Notice that the focus
of the toolbar will have shifted to the object item. Click in the
canvas, and a sheet of the type you selected will be added to the
model. You can repeat this process until you have all the sheets you
require for your model.</p>
<p>To allow responses to propagate through your model, you need to
connect the sheets together. Click on the connection pull down and a
list of all the existing types of projections will be presented.
This list collects the pre-defined projections available to
Topographica and is described later. Select the type of projection
you want, for example, for a standard connection with a receptive
field select a CFProjection. The canvas is now in connection mode,
this means it will expect you to drag the mouse from one sheet to
another (or to the same sheet for feedback connections). To do this
click and hold the mouse over the sheet you want the connection to
be from. Then, while holding the mouse button down, move the mouse
to the sheet you want to be connected to. Release the mouse button:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="" src="../_images/editorconnectiondrag.png" />
</div>
<p>If the target location is near to an existing sheet, this will form
a connection between the two sheets and you will see the clear
representation for the connection as shown above. If you have
selected a sheet, but decide you don&#8217;t want a connection, release
the mouse in an area without any other components. To connect a
sheet to itself, simply select the sheet and release the mouse while
it is still over the same sheet.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-predefined-components">
<h3>The Predefined Components<a class="headerlink" href="#the-predefined-components" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Topographica supplies a library of components, composed of both
basic and specific sheets and projections. To understand what a
particular component does you should consult the Library section of
the reference manual, or look at the online help for an object in
the Parameters window (below). The Library section is divided into
several different parts, so you can view all the possible sheets or
projections available to you and use their descriptions to
understand how you can use them in your model.</p>
<p>The model editor&#8217;s lists populate themselves from this library, so
all the components described in the manual will be available for you
to use in the editor. The editor places no restrictions on how you
connect these components together, but some combinations that are
not supported may give error messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="extending-the-library">
<h3>Extending the Library<a class="headerlink" href="#extending-the-library" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Topographica team are regularly making additions to the library
and these additions are automatically available in the model editor.
If you decide to extend any of the components, simply save the files
in the same directory as the others of that type (or load it into
Python beforehand from any file) and your extension will
automatically be available for use in the model editor.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-parameters">
<span id="parameters"></span><h2>The Parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#the-parameters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All of the components that you can use to define a Topographica
model have parameters. Parameters are attributes that allow you to
control the behaviour of your components. To view the parameters
that a component has, right click on the component&#8217;s representation
in the work area. This will bring up a window with the component&#8217;s
name at the top and several entries underneath. You will notice that
these entries vary in style, for a description of the various types
of parameter and valid changes you can make to the parameters refer
to Controlling simulation parameters in the User Guide. Some
examples of entry methods are, sliders for real numbers or pull down
menus for class selectors and enumerations. In these cases you can
simply move the slider or select a different option from the menu to
change the parameter&#8217;s value:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="" src="../_images/editorproperties.png" />
</div>
<p>Many of the parameters will be set to a value that is an object with
its own parameters. In this case, right clicking on the value will
allow you to open a Properties window, which works just the same way
as the main Properties window for that object but sets values on the
sub-object instead.</p>
<p>Help for most of the options can be obtained by hovering the mouse
over the option&#8217;s name. Help for the entire object can be obtained
by hovering over the object&#8217;s name (&#8216;Surround&#8217; in this case).</p>
<p>Once you have made the necessary changes, clicking Apply sets these
changes on the component. Clicking Close shuts the window, unless
there are unapplied changes, in which case you can choose to save
them before the window closes. (Clicking the window&#8217;s close
icon&#8212;often an X in the top-right corner&#8212;has the same effect as
clicking &#8216;Close&#8217;.)</p>
<p>In addition to the Close and Apply buttons, a Defaults button is
also available for existing components (but not for new ones). This
button allows you to return the displayed values to their <em>class
defaults</em> . As with other changes, you must click Apply before they
take effect.</p>
<p>Finally, the Refresh button updates the displayed values to those
currently set on the component. Hence, it serves as a &#8216;reset&#8217; button
when there are unapplied changes, but also allows you to update the
displayed values to the ones currently on the component if the
compenent has been altered outside the GUI (at the commandline, for
instance).</p>
<div class="section" id="changing-constants-and-default-values">
<h3>Changing constants and default values<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-constants-and-default-values" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Parameters section of the User Guide also details that a
parameter can be declared as a constant. This means you cannot
change it once the component has been made. To ensure consistency,
the model editor must create the components as soon as you make them
in the editor, so these values must already be set. To set constant
values (as well as default values in general) before instantiating
the object, the parameters of the object about to be created can be
changed using the parameters listed underneath the toolbar.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="saving-a-new-or-modified-model">
<h3>Saving a new or modified model<a class="headerlink" href="#saving-a-new-or-modified-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Topographica console Simulation menu offers two options for
saving simulations once you are done editing them: &#8216;Save snapshot&#8217;
and &#8216;Save script&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8216;Save snapshot&#8217; saves a complete record in a .typ file of all state
of the current simulation, which allows that simulation to be
restored with exactly the same state later. However, because this
option requires saving a large portion of the internal state of
Topographica, the snapshot file might not be loadable in a different
version of Topographica after an upgrade. Thus .typ snapshots should
be considered only temporary storage for a model.</p>
<p>&#8216;Save script&#8217; instead generates a Python script that, when run, will
generate a model with the same architecture as the one currently in
memory. This option is generally more useful for models created in
the Model Editor, because the resulting text file has very little of
the internal state of Topographica, and it can easily be edited when
necessary to work with other Topographica versions. Moreover, the
resulting .ty script can be edited to add features not yet supported
by the Model Editor. Thus it is generally best to save a new model
as a .ty script rather than a .typ snapshot. Note that some editing
of the .ty script may be necessary to make the script truly
runnable, for features that have not yet been updated to provide
good script representations, but such changes are typically quite
minor.</p>
