Topographica comes with the following step-by-step guides to running
simulations:

:doc:`gcal`

How to run and test a simple orientation map simulation using the
GCAL cortical model. The tutorial allows you to present various
objects to a saved orientation map network, and to visualize and
analyze the responses. It also shows how to develop a new simulation
using different input patterns.

:doc:`lissom_oo_or`

Same tutorial as for GCAL, but using the older, more complex, less
robust LISSOM model, which has been more extensively described in
publications.

:doc:`som_retinotopy`

How to run a model that develops selectivity for position, mapping
the input space to the cortical space. The model uses the abstract
SOM algorithm, focusing on the basic principles of self-organization
rather than modeling any particular biological system.

These should be good starting points for seeing how Topographica
works and how to use a Topographica model. If you develop any other
tutorials for your own models, we would love to add them here!
